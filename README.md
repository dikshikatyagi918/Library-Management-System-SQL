# 📚 Library Management System (SQL Project)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Library Management System** designed using **SQL**.  
It demonstrates how relational databases can be used to efficiently manage library operations such as:
- Adding and maintaining books
- Managing members and borrowers
- Recording issue and return transactions
- Tracking overdue books and fines

The project was developed as part of my learning journey in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**.
